Certificate of Origin (DCO) — see below.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1 to track contribution
provenance. By signing off on a commit, you certify that you wrote the code
or otherwise have the right to contribute it under the project's open-source
license. The full DCO text is at <https://developercertificate.org/>:

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

### Signing commits

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` trailer attesting to the DCO.
The easiest way is `git commit -s`, which auto-inserts the trailer using
your configured `user.name` and `user.email`:

```
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

The trailer looks like:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

PRs without DCO sign-off on every commit will be asked to amend
(`git commit --amend -s`) or rebase with sign-off
(`git rebase --signoff origin/master`).

## Development workflow

- Use a feature branch for non-trivial changes.
- Keep commits focused and reviewable; split large changes.
- Run the default test suite before opening a PR:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Guidelines

- Prefer small, reviewable commits.
- Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, logs, backups, or local infrastructure notes.
- Keep public docs generic and portable.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.

## Reporting issues

Please include:

- what you expected
- what happened
- reproduction steps
- relevant logs or tracebacks
