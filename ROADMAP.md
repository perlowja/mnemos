# MNEMOS Roadmap

Forward-looking scope for MNEMOS releases beyond the current version. Current shipping version in `pyproject.toml`. Release-by-release history in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

This document is kept intentionally narrow. It lists what the next release will contain, what has been consciously deferred, and why. It does not list wishlist items, speculative features, or aspirational claims.

## v3.1 — compression platform + v3.0 unblocks

**Headline:** plugin-interfaced compression platform with competitive per-memory engine selection, a persisted audit log on every compression decision, and a first-class GPU batcher that works across integrated graphics, discrete GPUs, and remote OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

Three engines shipped under the platform in v3.1: LETHE (extractive, CPU), ALETHEIA (LLM-assisted token importance, GPU-required), and ANAMNESIS (LLM fact extraction, GPU-optional). The going-forward stack is LETHE + ANAMNESIS + APOLLO — ALETHEIA was retired from the default contest in the v3.2 tail on the back of the 2026-04-23 benchmark (0 contest wins, index-list prompt incompatible with instruction-tuned generalist LLMs) and is scheduled for v4.0 removal. The `CompressionEngine` ABC is open: operators can register additional engines, and the first-party third engine of the going-forward stack (APOLLO — schema-aware dense encoding for LLM-to-LLM consumption) is staged across v3.3–v3.4 (see "Apollo Program" below).

### Tier 1 — small fixes that unblock real surfaces (shipped on master)

1. **MCP stdio server path prefix.** The published stdio MCP server in `mcp_server.py` called `/memories*` but the REST router registers `/v1/memories*`. Nine of fourteen memory-related MCP tools returned 404 against a default install. Fixed with the prefix + an end-to-end wire regression test (`tests/test_mcp_stdio_wire.py`).
2. **Installer `api_keys` schema.** Fresh installs with auth enabled failed at seed because `installer/db.py` wrote columns that no longer existed on the schema. Aligned the insert with the current `db/migrations_v1_multiuser.sql` table definition.
3. **Federation-role admin provisioning.** `api/handlers/admin.py` rejected `role="federation"` at validator time; `api/handlers/federation.py` required that role. Extended the admin validator so peer onboarding no longer requires direct DB writes.

### Tier 2 — the compression platform (v3.1.0 GA)

4. **Three-engine roster under a plugin ABC.** LETHE (extractive token/sentence filtering — honest about being rule-based, not ML), ALETHEIA (LLM-assisted semantic rewriting with swappable small-LLM judge — `gemma4:e2b` default, `gemma4:e4b` for quality-critical paths), and ANAMNESIS (LLM fact extraction — atomic facts, entities, concepts, summary). The `CompressionEngine` ABC is adapted from the plugin-interface pattern in OpenClaw's `CompactionProvider` (credited prior art). Operators can register additional engines at startup; the ABC is public and documented.
5. **Competitive selection.** The distillation worker runs every eligible engine per memory, scores each candidate via a composite function (quality × compression ratio × speed factor, with a quality floor that disqualifies damaged candidates), and keeps the winner. The manifest records both the winner and every losing candidate with its score and disqualification reason — a full audit trail of every compression decision. Scoring profile is operator-configurable (`balanced`, `quality_first`, `speed_first`, `custom`) via `~/.mnemos/compression_scoring.toml`.
6. **GPU endpoint circuit breaker + CPU-fallback coordination.** `compression/gpu_guard.py` tracks the health of each configured `GPU_PROVIDER_HOST` via a per-endpoint circuit breaker (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED). GPU-backed engines consult the guard before every HTTP call; when the circuit is open, they fast-fail with `reject_reason='disabled'` instead of piling doomed requests onto a dead endpoint. Each engine declares `gpu_intent` (`cpu_only` | `gpu_optional` | `gpu_required`); `gpu_required` engines (ALETHEIA, ANAMNESIS) skip when the circuit is open, `gpu_optional` engines (none in v3.1) would degrade to a CPU path if they had one, `cpu_only` engines (LETHE) never consult the guard. Endpoint is backend-agnostic — Ollama on an Intel iGPU, vLLM on an A10, a remote provider. **Actual request batching** (accumulating concurrent calls into one HTTP roundtrip) is a v3.2 optimization; modern inference servers (vLLM, Ollama) already batch internally at the model layer, so the v3.1 work is the correctness surface (fast-fail + routing) rather than the throughput surface.
7. **Manifest read endpoint.** `GET /v1/memories/{id}/compression-manifests` returns the winner + candidates + scoring trace for every compression decision, as JSON. Read-only view over `memory_compressed_variants` and `memory_compression_candidates`.
8. **Migration.** `db/migrations_v3_1_compression.sql` adds `memory_compressed_variants` (winner), `memory_compression_candidates` (full contest log), and `memory_compression_queue` (write-time task queue). Migration is idempotent and has been dry-run-validated against a real pgvector/pg16 container. **In v3.1 these tables are populated by the distillation worker; read paths continue to serve `memories.content` unchanged.** Hot-path invocation (rehydrate / gateway inject / session context reading the winner variant) is a substantial separate surface with its own audit, benchmarks, and migration story — scheduled for v3.2 alongside APOLLO.

### Shipping criteria for v3.1.0

- Every Tier 1 item already on master (verified).
- Every Tier 2 item lands with unit tests plus at least one live integration test against real infrastructure (no mocks-only coverage on the success path for any GPU-touching engine).
- End-to-end contract tests for MCP stdio wire compatibility (already shipped) and the new compression contest path.
- `docs/benchmarks/compression-2026-04-23.md` with measured numbers across a real stratified memory sample from the production install — not single-input anecdata. **Shipped.** 49 memories from PYTHIA, three engines against gemma-4-E4B-it on CERBERUS. LETHE won 30, ANAMNESIS won 18, ALETHEIA won 0 (disabled by default on the finding that its index-list prompt doesn't survive instruction-tuned models). See `docs/benchmarks/compression-2026-04-23.md` for full findings including one real bug surfaced and fixed.
- `CHANGELOG.md` entry listing every item above, with SHA references.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` updated with the single-worker constraint and the scaling roadmap pointer.

### Consciously out of v3.1 scope (moved to later releases)

These were in earlier v3.1 plans and have been explicitly deferred to keep v3.1 tight and deliverable:

- **APOLLO engine + schema-aware dense encoding.** Moved to v3.2–v3.4 staged rollout (see "Apollo Program" below). The design needs deliberate time — not mining 1966-era NASA telemetry docs, but building on InvestorClaw's consultative-LLM pipeline as the canonical working pattern.
- **Narration endpoint** (`GET /v1/memories/{id}/narrate`). APOLLO's companion read path; deferred to v3.2 with APOLLO itself.
- **Hot-path compression-variant reads.** Making `/v1/memories/rehydrate`, the gateway inject path, and the session context injection path serve the winning compressed variant instead of raw `memories.content` is a substantial change to the read surface. The v3.1 tables hold the winners; v3.2 wires the reads.
- **Tier 3 tenancy fixes** (KG `owner_id`, namespace enforcement on memory paths, application-layer owner filter, registry-backed `/v1/models`). These deserve a dedicated tenancy-focused release. Targeted for **v3.1.1** as a follow-on patch series, with migration guides and per-fix regression coverage.
- **Horizontal scaling.** GRAEAE reliability primitives (circuit breakers, rate limiters, semaphores) are in-process singletons today; moving them to shared state is a dedicated refactor. v3.1 documents the single-worker constraint prominently in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Apollo Program — v3.2 to v3.4 staged rollout

APOLLO is the going-forward stack's schema-aware engine: dense encoding targeted at **LLM-to-LLM wire use**, not human reading. The insight is that LETHE and ANAMNESIS both assume the final reader is human or a search-ranking pass. APOLLO assumes the final reader is a downstream LLM (a GRAEAE muse, a consultative agent, a tool-use caller) and encodes accordingly: typed key:value dense forms that LLMs parse natively in fewer tokens than the prose equivalent. Humans read through a narrator at read time; the raw dense form is never shown to them.

The canonical production pattern is InvestorClaw's consultative layer, which already demonstrates that `AAPL:100@150.25/175.50:tech` (12 tokens) is equivalent context for a downstream LLM to the 50-token prose sentence it was derived from.

Rolled out in stages, Saturn V-style — each stage delivers a usable payload on separation, not a deferred promise.

### v3.2 — S-IC (first stage: get off the pad) — **SHIPPED v3.2.0–v3.2.4**

- ✅ `APOLLOEngine` under the `CompressionEngine` ABC; `gpu_intent=gpu_optional`.
- ✅ First schema: portfolio. **v3.3 already added decision / person / event / commit / code schemas**, ahead of the original v3.3 plan.
- ✅ Rule-based detection (regex) with LLM fallback via ANAMNESIS-pattern httpx scaffolding. Fallback gated behind `MNEMOS_APOLLO_LLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED`; turned off in PYTHIA prod after v3.2.4 audit found 4.4% win rate without judge.
- ✅ Narration endpoint (`GET /v1/memories/{id}/narrate`).
- ✅ Judge-LLM scoring integrated; `MNEMOS_JUDGE_ENABLED` toggle.
- ✅ Hot-path reads wired: rehydrate / gateway / session-context paths read winner variant when present.
- ✅ ARTEMIS — CPU-only extractive engine added alongside APOLLO; LETHE retired from default contest.

### v3.3 — S-II (second stage: to upper atmosphere) — **SHIPPED in part (v3.3.0-alpha.1)**

- ✅ Additional schemas already shipped in v3.2 tail (decision, person, event, code, commit) with adversarial regression tests.
- 🔵 DAG wiring for derivations: still planned. Each compression candidate as a `memory_versions` child row with `parent_version_id → root`, branch='distilled'; narrated as branch='narrated'. Content-addressed, tamper-evident.
- 🔵 Read-path routing on `Accept` headers: `text/plain` → narrated; `application/x-apollo-dense` → raw dense.
- ✅ **MORPHEUS dream-state subsystem (slice 1: foundation).** v3.3.0-alpha.1 ships `morpheus_runs` table + per-row `morpheus_run_id` tagging + admin/observability API + rollback contract. Synthesis logic stubbed; slice 2 fills it in. Architecture per GRAEAE consensus 2026-04-25: append-only synthesis first, mutation paths (CONSOLIDATE / EXTRACT / ARCHIVE) deferred to v3.6+.
- 🔵 **MORPHEUS slice 2** in flight: real cluster + synthesise phases, cron timer at 03:17 UTC, recall-frequency tracking columns (absorbed from OpenClaw dreaming patterns), per-cluster introspection artifact, per-namespace dream scoping. Drops the `-alpha` when it lands.

### v3.4 — S-IVB (third stage: trans-lunar injection) — **PLAN UPDATED 2026-04-25**

The original v3.4 plan was distill-on-ingest + ANAMNESIS deprecation. Both still in scope, but the headline shifts based on the v3.2.x audit pass and the post-MORPHEUS roadmap:

- 🔵 **CHARON v0.2 — full MPF v0.2 sidecars.** Server-side import/export for `kind in {document, fact, event, kg_triples, relations, compression_manifest, memory_versions}`. Adapter `payload_version` normalization (Graphiti / Cognee currently mislabel `kind=event/fact/document` as `mnemos-3.1` instead of `mpf-0.1` — schema becomes authoritative). Per-adapter validate-before-post + skipped-record reporting. Round-trip CI tests: `memory_export json/jsonl → memory_import --preserve-metadata` per adapter.
- 🔵 **KNOSSOS solidify (phase 2).** Tunnels (`mempalace_create_tunnel` / `_list_tunnels` / `_delete_tunnel`), diary read/write, `_get_aaak_spec` for round-trip with MemPalace-compressed drawers. End-to-end test against a real OpenClaw + MemPalace stack. Migration guide for MemPalace operators.
- 🔵 **First wave of goodwill PRs to MemPalace.** 2–3 small, high-value upstream contributions: bug fixes from their tracker, an `export --mpf-v0.1` mode, doc improvements spotted while building KNOSSOS adapters. Establishes contributor presence ahead of the Track 4 RFC.
- 🔵 Distill-on-ingest as default write path (carried forward from original v3.4 plan).
- 🔵 ANAMNESIS deprecation path; APOLLO LLM-fallback subsumes its role. Stays importable until v4.0.
- 🔵 Full round-trip fidelity benchmark as GA gate.

### v3.5 — MemPalace RFC re-engagement + compression hot-paths

- 🔵 **RFC-002**: re-open the MemPalace bridge conversation with v3.4 evidence in hand (compression contest, MORPHEUS dreams, GPU budget, KNOSSOS phase 2). Frame as positive-sum: their local-first ethos + our production-scale capacity, KNOSSOS as the interop point. Address the "scare" honestly — different problems, composable answers.
- 🔵 Compression hot-path expansion: more read paths consume `memory_compressed_variants` instead of raw `memories.content` when a winner exists. Specific surfaces: federation feed (peers receive compressed, save bandwidth), session message replay, MCP `get_memory`.
- 🔵 Search response `compression_applied` / `compression_metadata` fields decision (Codex audit deferred): either wire a real summary path for large-result-set compression, or formally document as reserved.
- 🔵 Design paper draft: git-like DAG + LLM-synthesized distillation + LLM-synthesized narration + judge-verified fidelity (carried from v3.4 charter).

### v3.6 — PERSEPHONE + MORPHEUS mutation paths

- 🔵 **PERSEPHONE — archival subsystem.** Cold-set rotation: memories not recalled in M days move to compressed archival storage with a stub pointer in the live table. Recall-tracking columns from v3.3 feed the eligibility decision. Restore on demand. Federation-aware (peers see archive marker, can request restore).
- 🔵 MORPHEUS slice 3 — CONSOLIDATE phase. Merge near-duplicate clusters into a canonical with `permission_mode=400` read-only pointers on originals (`consolidated_into:<canonical_id>`). Soft-delete only; never hard-delete user data. Federation-safe (peers can see merge happened).
- 🔵 MORPHEUS slice 4 — EXTRACT phase. LLM mining of latent KG triples from `verbatim_content` of prose memories not already triplified. Two-model split: fast/quantized for extraction, strong reasoner for synthesis (already the v3.3 slice 2 pattern).

### Deferred beyond v3.4

- Full observability surface (Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces, default Grafana dashboard).
- Secrets abstraction (unified `SecretsProvider` interface with env-var passthrough, Vault plug-in, KMS plug-in).
- DAG merge conflict resolution (three-way merge with operator-assisted resolution).
- Embedding-axis quantization beyond pgvector's built-in `halfvec` and `bit` types — revisit when official TurboQuant / PolarQuant / QJL reference implementations land with compatible licenses.
- Migration rollback tooling.

## v4.0 — Pluggable Monolith + Surface Integrations + Lite Profile

The 4.0 charter is structural, not feature-driven. Three coupled work streams:

### Track 5 — modularization + persistence abstraction

Same repo, internal API boundaries enforced by tooling. Pattern: Django, SQLAlchemy, Airflow.

- 🔵 `src/mnemos/` package layout. Subsystems become subpackages (`mnemos.graeae`, `mnemos.compression`, `mnemos.morpheus`, `mnemos.federation`, `mnemos.charon`, `mnemos.knossos`).
- 🔵 `import-linter` config in `pyproject.toml`. CI fails on cross-subsystem internal imports.
- 🔵 Public APIs via `__all__`; private surfaces under `_internal/`.
- 🔵 `installer/` extracted to a separate package (operators don't need it at runtime).
- 🔵 Plugin entry-points for `CompressionEngine`, judges, federation backends, MORPHEUS phases. Third-party engines install as packages and self-register on startup.
- 🔵 Optional-extras: `pip install mnemos-os`, `mnemos-os[graeae,morpheus]`, `mnemos-os[full]`. Lets embedding apps pull only the slice they need.
- 🔵 **Persistence abstraction** — `mnemos.persistence.{postgres,sqlite}` swappable. Foundation for the lite profile (next).

### Track 5b — SQLite "lite" profile

Same code, same API, same KNOSSOS interop. Single-binary, embeddable, MemPalace-compatible MCP from day one.

- 🔵 `mnemos.persistence.sqlite` implementation: SQLite + `sqlite-vec` (replaces pgvector) + FTS5 (replaces pg's tsvector).
- 🔵 SQL dialect translation: `<=>` cosine ops, jsonb, generated columns, partial indexes — the persistence layer hides this.
- 🔵 Migration parity: `db/migrations/sqlite/` mirrors `db/migrations/postgres/`. Same conceptual schema, different SQL.
- 🔵 Single-binary build: `pyinstaller`-style bundle that ships MNEMOS + SQLite-vec + the static assets in one executable.
- 🔵 Pitch: **"Run it as a single SQLite binary on your laptop, scale it to a Postgres+pgvector+GPU stack on a fleet, anywhere in between."** The MemPalace-compatible variant of MNEMOS that doesn't sacrifice the schema-extensibility our database choice gives us.

### Track 6 — surface integrations (multi-vendor MCP + REST connectors)

MNEMOS exposes a mature MCP server (`mcp_server.py`, 13 tools, working in Claude Code today). Goal: make MNEMOS the easiest memory layer to wire into *any* agent surface. v4.0 ships a connectors gallery + bridge tooling for the surfaces that don't natively speak MCP.

| Surface | MCP support | Plan |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ native | Already working; document the registration recipe |
| **Claude Desktop** | ✅ native | Same MCP server file; document config-file path |
| **Cursor** | ✅ native | Same MCP; document `~/.cursor/mcp.json` registration |
| **Codex CLI** (OpenAI's dev tool) | ✅ native (0.125.0+) | Verify config path + ship a `codex mcp add mnemos` recipe |
| **Cline / Continue / Aider** | ✅ native | One-line MCP config snippets in docs |
| **ChatGPT Pro / Team / Enterprise / Edu (web)** | ✅ via Developer Mode | Custom-connector registration; MNEMOS MCP exposed over HTTP/SSE transport. Document the connector-config recipe |
| **ChatGPT free / Plus (consumer)** | ❌ no MCP at this tier | OpenAPI manifest + Custom GPT calling MNEMOS REST API. Bridge until OpenAI broadens MCP access |
| **ChatGPT Desktop app** | ⚠️ partial | Track app-side connector support as it stabilizes |
| **Gemini / Code Assist / IDX** | ❌ no MCP | Build `mcp-to-gemini-functions` bridge: translate MCP tool definitions to Gemini's function-calling JSON schema. Document REST-direct path as fallback |
| **OpenWebUI / LM Studio / Ollama** | ⚠️ partial | OpenAI-compat tool-call path; MNEMOS REST endpoints accessible via tool-use config |

Deliverables:
- 🔵 `docs/connectors/` directory with one Markdown per surface, including the exact config snippet to paste.
- 🔵 `mnemos-openapi.json` published as a downloadable artifact in CI; consumed by Custom GPTs and any OpenAPI-aware client.
- 🔵 `mnemos-bridges/gemini/` — small Python package that runs alongside MNEMOS, exposes the MCP tool surface as a Gemini-compatible REST endpoint.
- 🔵 `mnemos-bridges/openai-actions/` — Custom GPT manifest + OAuth scaffold for the consumer ChatGPT path.
- 🔵 Smoke tests per surface in CI (where automatable; some surfaces require real credentials and are manual).

## Audit Remediation Log

Every Codex / GRAEAE / stop-hook audit finding from the v3.2.x and v3.3.x cycles, with status. Maintained release-by-release; new findings append. ✅ = remediated, 🔵 = planned, ⏳ = deferred.

### Codex round 1 — 9-commit deep probe (early v3.2.x cycle)

5 bugs found across the session's commit set 71b40e0..58011a9; all fixed in commit `1c56488` (compression scoring math, Artemis assembly, Apollo schema FP guards).

- ✅ All 5 bugs remediated.

### Stop-hook reviews during v3.2.1 development

- ✅ `federation.py` non-UTC ISO 8601 cursor handling — UTC-normalize before strip-tzinfo (v3.2.1).
- ✅ Startup-time GRAEAE manifest reload stalls boot + holds DB conn — moved to `_schedule_background()` with 120s `wait_for` cap; Phase 1 (DB) releases conn before Phase 2 (parallel probes) (v3.2.1).
- ✅ Background reload undone by concurrent consult overrides — overrides via `model_override` param; `_query_provider` snapshots provider config (v3.2.1).
- ✅ Override refactor broke gateway model-override path — `engine.route()` now passes `model_override`; gateway strips matching prefix (v3.2.1).
- ✅ Gateway prefix-strip breaks legitimate slash-bearing model IDs — strip only matching `<provider>/`; resolver tries bare + namespaced lookups (v3.2.1).
- ✅ Bare `claude-opus-4-7` resolves to `anthropic` not `claude` (engine key) — reverse-map `_REGISTRY_MAP`; strip accepts either name as prefix (v3.2.1).
- ✅ Resolver semantics changed without test updates — 1 test updated, 3 new tests added; 10/10 pass (v3.2.1).

### Codex deep-review of v3.2.1 (task `task-modqloxk-o6tgad`)

3 HIGH blockers + several validations.

- ✅ `mnemos_version_snapshot()` UPDATE branch wrote OLD into version rows (semantics inverted) — UPDATE now inserts NEW; migration `db/migrations_v3_2_2_version_snapshot_new_values.sql` (v3.2.2).
- ✅ Federation cursor timezone drift — `next_cursor` now emitted with explicit `Z` suffix; puller's `astimezone(UTC)` is a no-op (v3.2.2).
- ✅ Custom Query selection silently dropped Anthropic muse — `_REGISTRY_TO_GRAEAE` reverse-map applied to `_resolve_models` / `_tier_lineup` / providers-list path (v3.2.2).
- ✅ Validated: auth-gating on new endpoints, gateway resolver matrix, race-fix shape, ARGONAS cherry-picks runtime-benign.

### Codex source-vs-live audit (after v3.2.2 reconcile)

- ✅ Version-source drift: `_version.py` single literal; api_server / health / portability all import; pyproject + pip metadata + /health + /openapi.json all agree at 3.2.3 (v3.2.3).
- ✅ Docker pip metadata stale at 3.1.0: `.dockerignore` drops `*.egg-info`; Dockerfile installs the package after `COPY . .` (v3.2.3).
- ✅ `/v1/documents/import` bypass: now uses `mem_<hex12>` ids, populates `verbatim_content` / `quality_rating` / `permission_mode`, dispatches `memory.created` webhooks per chunk, invalidates search cache (v3.2.3).
- ✅ Stale docs: README current-version paragraph rewritten to v3.2.3; SPECIFICATION endpoint count 91→96; release-history extended (v3.2.3).
- 🔵 MPF portability partial (`kind=memory` only) — deferred to v3.4 CHARON v0.2.
- ⏳ `/v1/memories/search` `compression_applied` / `compression_metadata` reserved-but-always-false — decision pending: implement or formally document as reserved. Carried into v3.5.

### Codex round-2 portability + APOLLO audit (after v3.2.3)

- ⏳ MPF import is memory-only; rich envelopes (kg_triples, documents, facts, events, compression_manifest, memory_versions) silently dropped — deferred to v3.4 CHARON v0.2.
- ✅ Legacy `/memories` POST path returned 404 against current API (`/v1/memories`) — fixed (v3.2.4).
- ⏳ Adapter `payload_version` conflict (Graphiti / Cognee mislabel `kind=event/fact/document` as `mnemos-3.1` instead of `mpf-0.1`) — deferred to v3.4 CHARON v0.2.
- ✅ `_post_mpf` envelope missing `exported_at` (failed own validator) — added (v3.2.4).
- ✅ `tools/memory_export.py text` import error (`export_memories_text` → `export_memories_plaintext`) — fixed (v3.2.4).
- ✅ ChatGPT `--category` override ignored — now honored when set; auto-classify only when unset (v3.2.4).
- ✅ APOLLO LLM fallback wasted GPU without judge enabled (4.4% win rate on 2,146 dispatches/day) — startup warning when both enabled+judge-off; `MNEMOS_APOLLO_LLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED` flipped off in PYTHIA prod (v3.2.4 + ops).

### OpenClaw dream-architecture comparison (informational)

Pattern absorption opportunities surfaced by reading OpenClaw issues #70072, #65630, #67413, #70402, #64756.

- 🔵 Recall-frequency tracking columns (`recall_count`, `last_recalled_at`, `unique_queries`) — planned v3.3 slice 2.
- 🔵 Per-cluster introspection artifact (`morpheus_clusters` table + `/v1/morpheus/runs/{id}/clusters`) — planned v3.3 slice 2.
- 🔵 Per-namespace dream scoping (`morpheus_runs.namespace` filter) — planned v3.3 slice 2.
- ❌ Flat-file storage (`MEMORY.md` promotion target) — explicitly skipped; Postgres is canonical.
- ❌ Promotion-gate-as-primary-mechanism — explicitly skipped; MORPHEUS is synthesizer, not triage. PERSEPHONE (v3.6) covers archival decisions.
