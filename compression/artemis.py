"""ARTEMIS — CPU-only extractive compression engine.

Apollo's twin. Artemis hunts the essential content — tracks
identifiers and structure through dense prose, preserves what the
judge cares about, drops what it doesn't.

Apollo handles schema-typed dense encoding + LLM fallback for prose
that misses every schema; Artemis handles the pure-CPU path when
GPU is unavailable or latency-sensitive. Default contest engine
alongside Apollo; runs as the extractive peer that competes
directly with ANAMNESIS's LLM extraction on cost.

Design grounded in a GRAEAE multi-muse consultation (5 models
agreed unanimously on the stack): the 0.44 judge-mean of the
earlier stop-word extractive engine isn't a sentence-selection
problem — it's an information-dropping problem. The judge
penalizes missing identifiers, version strings, dates, URLs, and
broken labeled content. Fix those drops first; the rest is
sentence ranking.

The pipeline

  1. Protected-span regex pass — tags dates, versions, emails,
     URLs, numbers, IDs, quoted strings. These are sacred and get
     a PageRank boost; their host sentences are force-selected.
  2. Structure detection — recognizes "Key: Value" labeled blocks
     and preserves them verbatim as atomic units.
  3. TF-IDF sentence scoring — term-rarity-weighted scoring using
     stdlib Counter + math.log. Document centroid cosine similarity.
  4. Anchored TextRank — sentence-sentence cosine similarity graph
     + personalized PageRank biased toward sentences containing
     protected spans (Gemini's suggestion during the consultation).
     When networkx isn't installed, falls back to TF-IDF-only
     ranking (still a measurable improvement over stop-word
     filtering).
  5. MMR selection — greedy top-K with redundancy penalty. Forces
     inclusion of sentences that host protected spans.
  6. Assembly — re-order by original position, prepend labeled
     blocks, emit as prose.

Target latency: <20 ms on 4000-char inputs. Pure stdlib + numpy
(already required) + optional networkx. No GPU, no models on disk,
no network.

        #     survived into the output.
        #   * Anchored-sentence retention — sentences we explicitly
