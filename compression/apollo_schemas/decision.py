"""Decision schema — "decided X because Y, alternatives considered Z".

Dense form:
    DECISION:chose=<choice>[|because=<rationale>][|over=<alt1,alt2,...>]

Example:
    DECISION:chose=postgres|because=transactional audit chain|over=sqlite,mongo

Detection is strict by design — schema fires only on content that
explicitly signals a decision (marker word required) AND produces a
clean capture of the choice. Ambiguous content passes through to
APOLLO's LLM fallback instead of landing a garbled dense form.

Rationale: false positives in dense form are worse than false
negatives. A bad schema match produces a dense encoding that misses
the meaning; a fallback to LLM extraction captures it properly.
