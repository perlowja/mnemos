"""Judge-LLM fidelity scoring (v3.3 S-II).

Replaces engine self-reported ``quality_score`` values in the
compression contest with a judge-rated fidelity score. The judge is
a separate LLM call that compares the narrated form of each
compressed candidate against the root memory and returns a score in
[0, 1]. This is what lets APOLLO's LLM fallback (currently pinned
at 0.65 below the 0.70 quality floor) actually win contests on
fact-shaped content where its dense encoding preserves meaning
better than LETHE's extract.

Design

  * ``Judge`` ABC — single async ``score()`` method. Callers supply
    (original, candidate dense form, candidate narrated form,
    engine id). Return is a ``JudgeScore`` or ``None`` on failure.
  * ``LLMJudge`` — GPU-backed concrete judge. ANAMNESIS-pattern
    httpx scaffolding against ``GPU_PROVIDER_HOST``; GPUGuard
    integration for circuit-open short-circuit; JSON parse with
    strict shape checking; None on malformed output.
  * ``NullJudge`` — no-op for disabled / test paths. Used as the
    default when the contest runs without a configured judge.

Integration point is ``compression.contest.run_contest(judge=...)``:
when a judge is supplied, every surviving candidate gets its
``quality_score`` replaced by the judge's fidelity rating BEFORE
composite_score is computed. The engine's self-reported score is
preserved in the candidate's manifest under ``engine_quality_score``
for audit clarity. The judge's model_id is stamped on
``CompressionResult.judge_model`` so the audit trail records which
judge scored which candidate.

On judge failure (HTTP error, parse failure, circuit-open), the
candidate falls back to its engine self-reported score — the
contest never fails closed because the judge is down.

# ── CrossEncoderJudge — specialized small-model scorer ────────────────────
#
# Purpose-built reranker / STS models are 20–500M params — 10–100× smaller
# than an LLM judge. They produce a scalar similarity score directly
# instead of free-form reasoning + JSON, so they're dramatically faster
# (<50ms CPU) but lose the audit-trail narrative an LLM judge produces.
#
# Design choice: keep LLMJudge as the authoritative judge for scoring
# (reasoning narrative matters); use CrossEncoderJudge either stand-alone
# when latency dominates, or as the secondary scorer inside EnsembleJudge
# to gather correlation telemetry across two independent measurement
# paths. When the LLM and cross-encoder agree on most memories, that's
# evidence the LLM judge can eventually be relegated to disagreement-
# review mode. Until we have that evidence, the LLM stays primary.

    sigmoid so the fidelity lands in [0, 1] and is directly
