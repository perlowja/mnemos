# MNEMOS + GRAEAE

**A memory operating system for serious agentic work — not a memory-storage provider.**
**The memory system for everyone. We interoperate.**
**In daily production use since December 2025.**

The distinction matters. A *storage provider* gives you a place to put bytes. An *operating system* gives you named subsystems — a scheduler, a compressor, a process manager, a security layer, an auditor — that manage the full lifecycle of a resource the application no longer has to babysit.

MNEMOS is the second thing. It is the operating system for agent memory: a runtime composed of named subsystems that cooperate to manage the full lifecycle of memory across multiple agents, providers, and time horizons — **write, embed, compress, version, reason-over, audit, federate, archive** — each one a first-class citizen of the runtime, not a feature bolted onto a vector store.

- **MNEMOS** is the memory kernel and the overall system name. Storage, versioning, tiered compression, and lifecycle sit here.
- **GRAEAE** is the reasoning bus — a multi-provider consensus layer that scores and selects across live LLM backends with a cryptographic audit chain on every decision.
- **THE MOIRAI** (**LETHE**, **ANAMNESIS**, and **APOLLO** in v3.3+) is the compression subsystem — tiered engines that decide what part of a memory's thread survives, with a written receipt on every transformation. A fourth engine, **ALETHEIA**, shipped with v3.1 but was retired in the v3.2 tail after losing every contest in the 2026-04-23 benchmark; see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for the going-forward stack.
- A **self-maintaining model registry** keeps itself current from provider APIs and Arena.ai Elo rankings, so the kernel always knows what models exist, what they cost, and how good they currently are.
- **Federation**, **webhooks**, **OAuth**, **RLS**, **DAG versioning**, and the **/v1/** REST surface are services built on top of that kernel, not retrofits onto a library.

This is not vocabulary borrowed from a dictionary of compelling words. Each of those names is a subsystem with an actual code path, an actual SQL table, an actual lifecycle worker, and an actual failure mode. Read the source tree; it's laid out that way.

You can treat MNEMOS like a memory storage provider if you want — `POST /v1/memories`, `GET /v1/memories/{id}`, you're done. The system will happily oblige. But the reason it holds up in production is that everything underneath that surface is operating-system-shaped: write-ahead transactions on the audit chain, supervised workers for distillation, per-provider circuit breakers, hash-chained reasoning logs, named compression tiers with quality manifests, advisory-locked DAG merges, SSRF-hardened outbound webhooks, a dynamically-weighted model registry that updates itself. It is infrastructure built to operate, not a demo feature built to demo.

**What it is, concretely:**

- A FastAPI service (port 5002), PostgreSQL + pgvector backed. Python 3.11+. Apache-2.0.
- A single `/v1/*` REST surface covering memories, consultations, providers, sessions, webhooks, federation, and an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions gateway.
- A multi-LLM consensus reasoning layer (GRAEAE) that distributes one prompt across multiple providers, scores the responses, and writes a tamper-evident SHA-256 hash-chained audit entry — every time.
- Git-like DAG versioning on memory: `log`, `branch`, `merge`, `revert`. Every mutation snapshots.
- Tiered compression pipeline (LETHE CPU / ANAMNESIS archival / APOLLO schema-aware in v3.3+) with a written quality manifest on every transformation. Runs in the background distillation worker. v3.1 introduced the plugin `CompressionEngine` ABC, competitive per-memory selection, and a persisted audit log of winners and losers; v3.2 wired hot-path invocation (rehydrate / gateway inject / session context read the winning variant). ALETHEIA shipped with v3.1 but was retired in the v3.2 tail — see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).
- Per-owner multi-tenant isolation, Bearer API keys + OAuth/OIDC session cookies, SSRF-hardened webhooks, cross-instance federation with per-memory opt-in.
- Runs alongside your applications the way Redis, PostgreSQL, or a message bus would. Deploy once, every agent in your stack shares the same memory substrate.

The [v3.2 release](./ROADMAP.md) builds on v3.1's compression platform: per-user namespace tenancy end-to-end, full observability stack (request-ID correlation / Prometheus metrics / OpenTelemetry traces / opt-in structured JSON logs), registry-backed OpenAI-compatible gateway with no default-to-Groq, MPF v0.1 export/import, Custom Query mode on `/v1/consultations`, self-healing contest queue with stale-running sweep, and probe-identity handshake on the GPUGuard circuit breaker. The going-forward compression stack is **LETHE + ANAMNESIS + APOLLO** (APOLLO in v3.3+). **ALETHEIA** shipped as the v3.1 third engine but was retired in the v3.2 tail after zero contest wins in the 2026-04-23 CERBERUS benchmark — its index-list scoring prompt doesn't survive instruction-tuned generalist LLMs; kept importable via `MNEMOS_ALETHEIA_ENABLED=true` for operators who had it opted in, scheduled for v4.0 removal. **APOLLO** — schema-aware dense encoding for LLM-to-LLM wire use — is staged across v3.3–v3.4 (the "Apollo Program").

## Works with

MNEMOS is designed to be the memory layer for the agentic tooling you already use — not a replacement for it. We interoperate on purpose, over three mechanisms, so there is no language lock-in and no pressure to rewrite your agent around us.

### How we interoperate

1. **MCP (Model Context Protocol).** MNEMOS ships a stdio MCP server (`mcp_server.py`) that exposes memory operations — search, create, update, delete, DAG versioning, model optimizer — as first-class tool calls. Register it in any MCP-aware client (Claude Code, OpenClaw, ZeroClaw, Hermes) and the agent gets persistent memory without your framework having to know MNEMOS exists at the code level.
2. **OpenAI-compatible gateway.** `POST /v1/chat/completions` and `GET /v1/models` are drop-in for the OpenAI SDK. Point `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at your MNEMOS instance and any client that already speaks OpenAI gets memory injection, multi-provider routing, and consensus scoring with zero code change. This is the path for LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen, and anything else that was written against the OpenAI wire protocol.
3. **Native `/v1/*` REST surface.** For integrations that want to speak to MNEMOS directly: `/v1/memories`, `/v1/consultations`, `/v1/providers`, `/sessions`, `/v1/webhooks`, `/v1/federation`, `/kg/triples`. The full API is language-agnostic; pick your HTTP client and go.

### Today's integration inventory

- **[Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)** — drop-in hooks (session-start / user-prompt-submit / stop), skill config, and MCP server. See `integrations/claude-code/`. *MCP.*
- **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** — AGENTS.md skill snippet + MCP registration. See `integrations/openclaw/`. *MCP.*
- **[ZeroClaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw)** — memory skill over MCP. Works without adding any Python dependency to ZeroClaw's Rust runtime — memory ops cross the wire to a MNEMOS instance running wherever. See `integrations/zeroclaw/`. *MCP.*
- **[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/nousresearch/hermes-agent)** — optional persistence backend for team / multi-tenant / compliance-regulated Hermes deployments. See `integrations/hermes/`. *MCP + REST.*
- **[MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace)** — graduation path, not a replacement. A portability schema + importer lets a MemPalace user who grows into a team preserve their drawers and palaces rather than start over. See [RFC #1112 on MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace/discussions/1112). *REST bulk import.*
- **[Mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) / [Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) / [Zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep)** — one-shot bulk consolidation via `POST /v1/memories/bulk`. If you already have a running memory store elsewhere and need to converge, MNEMOS is where they converge *to*. *REST bulk import.*
- **[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) / [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)** — works today via the **OpenAI-compatible gateway**: point `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at MNEMOS and memory injection + multi-provider routing land automatically. *OpenAI-compat.*
- **[CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) / [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen)** — shared memory across agents in a crew / group. Works today via the **OpenAI-compatible gateway**. *OpenAI-compat.*

The integrations bundle under [`integrations/`](./integrations/) is the living inventory. New integrations ship as SKILL.md + MCP config + enforcement snippet per framework, plus idempotent install/uninstall scripts where the target framework supports them.

MNEMOS runs as a network service — you deploy it once, alongside PostgreSQL and Redis, and every agent in your stack shares the same memory kernel over REST. It is not a desktop library, not an in-process helper, not a framework you import. Different form factor, different user, and specifically not a replacement for projects like MemPalace that serve the desktop / single-user case well.

---

## Why this exists

MNEMOS was built out of a very practical frustration: serious agentic systems keep losing context at exactly the moment reliability starts to matter.

In most AI tooling, memory is still treated like a convenience feature. A session ends, context evaporates, and the next run has to reconstruct the same decisions, assumptions, architecture tradeoffs, and operating knowledge from scratch. That may be tolerable for hobby projects. It is not good enough for professional users building production systems.

The first version of the problem looked simple. Keep a large context file, inject it into the prompt, and move on. That works until the context becomes expensive, stale, opaque, and impossible to selectively trust. When you compress it, you no longer know exactly what was removed. When multiple agents need it, the whole approach collapses into duplication and drift.

The second version of the problem was operational. Real agentic development means multiple models, multiple providers, failure modes, cost pressure, and different classes of tasks. Memory that cannot survive provider failure, cannot be shared across agents, or cannot explain its own transformations is not really infrastructure.

MNEMOS was built to solve those problems in a way that reflects real platform experience: provenance matters, compression should be inspectable, shared systems need access controls, and memory should behave like a service you can operate, not a feature you hope keeps working.

Its design is informed by years of enterprise platform work, large-vendor systems thinking, open-source infrastructure experience, and current work in the AI industry, without assuming that professional users want marketing language where they really need operational clarity.

**MNEMOS has been in daily production use since December 2025**, backing multiple active agentic systems simultaneously. By early 2026 the running install was holding thousands of memories and had performed thousands of compressions, each with a written quality manifest. The v3.0 release line unified that production codebase into the single-service FastAPI shape shipped here; v3.1.0 is the current shipping version and adds a plugin `CompressionEngine` ABC, a competitive per-memory contest across three built-in engines, and a persisted audit log of every winner and loser. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full v3.0.x / v3.1 release history.

For the longer story — the original catalyzing moment, the architectural decisions (and mistakes) that took MNEMOS from a single-file prototype to a unified runtime, and the scrubs, refactors, and release-gate audits that landed the public cut — see [`EVOLUTION.md`](./EVOLUTION.md). Written for future contributors as much as for future readers who want to know what they're inheriting.

## Who this is for

MNEMOS is built for the teams and operators who have already outgrown the prototype memory layer.

**You probably want MNEMOS if:**

- You run multiple agents, or multiple LLM providers, and they need to share a consistent memory pool that survives process restarts and provider outages.
- Your agents produce outputs someone downstream has to trust — an auditor, a regulator, a customer, a compliance team, yourself in six months.
- You care whether your memory layer can corrupt, silently swallow writes, or quietly truncate things you wanted to keep.
- You need real auth (API keys *and* OAuth/OIDC) and real multi-tenant isolation, not a bearer-token sticker over a single-user SQLite file.
- You have regulatory pressure around reasoning traceability — EMIR Article 57, SOC-2 evidence, GDPR right-to-explanation, or internal model-governance review boards.
- You need a memory substrate that survives schema migrations, provider circuit-breakers, and federation failures without hand-holding.

**Who this is actually serving, concretely:**

- **Agentic-tooling teams** running multi-agent stacks (crews, swarms, orchestrators) that keep losing shared context at the process boundary.
- **Platform teams inside larger orgs** wiring LLM routing + memory into an internal developer platform and needing a substrate they can operate, not babysit.
- **Regulated-industry AI teams** (finance, healthcare, legal, public sector) that need a cryptographic audit trail on every reasoning step and cannot ship without one.
- **Research labs** exploring consensus-reasoning, long-horizon agent memory, and memory-poisoning defenses — MNEMOS ships DAG versioning and an anti-poisoning guide precisely because those problems are real.
- **Founders** who've already hit the ceiling of in-process memory libraries and need something that survives process restarts, schema changes, and multi-agent concurrency.
- **The 56-year-old former IBM / Microsoft veteran** who has been thoroughly indoctrinated into architectural thinking and mission-critical design, and physically cringes at a memory layer that doesn't have the "-isms" and "-itabilities" thought through — atomicity, idempotency, referential integrity, ACIDism on the write path; durability, recoverability, observability, auditability, testability on the operate path; the things your old DBA would have red-pen'd in a review twenty years ago and your old SRE would red-pen now. This is for you. We know.

**You probably don't need MNEMOS if:**

- You are building a single-user chatbot for personal note-taking and raw similarity search over ChromaDB is fine.
- You only need short-term conversation history within a single session and your SDK already handles that.
- You don't care whether compressed context is faithful to the original — the "toy" solutions are honest about not providing that guarantee.
- The phrases *audit trail*, *tamper evidence*, *multi-tenant isolation*, and *compression manifest* don't mean anything to your use case and never will.

If you're in the first list, MNEMOS is designed specifically for you. If you're in the second list, something lighter will serve you better — use Mem0, Zep, or in-process summary buffers. They exist because those use cases are real. MNEMOS is the answer to a different question.

---

## Why use this

The field of agent memory systems is crowded and getting more so. Here is the honest case for MNEMOS.

**Most memory systems answer one question badly:** "What did this agent say before?"

That is conversation history. It is useful, but it is not memory infrastructure. Conversation history dies when the session ends, scales to one agent, and tells you nothing about whether the information it contains is still accurate, still complete, or safe to rely on.

MNEMOS answers a different set of questions:

- *When I compressed that memory to fit in a context window, what did I throw away — and was it safe to throw away?*
- *If three of my LLM providers go down, does my reasoning layer fail or degrade gracefully?*
- *Can multiple agents share one memory pool without rebuilding context from scratch each session?*

If none of those questions matter for your use case, a simpler tool is probably the right choice. If they do matter, read on.

### The specific gaps in the alternatives

| System | What it does | What it cannot tell you |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| [**MemGPT / Letta**](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) | Hierarchical paging within a single agent session | What was lost in compression; what happens when the LLM provider fails |
| [**Mem0**](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) | Store and retrieve memories via API | Compression quality; reasoning consensus |
| [**Zep**](https://github.com/getzep/zep) | Conversation history + entity extraction | Compression manifests; multi-provider reasoning |
| [**LangChain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) / [**LlamaIndex**](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) memory | In-process buffer or summary | Anything after the process exits |
| [**MemPalace**](https://github.com/mempalace/mempalace) | Desktop-library long-horizon memory with spatial retrieval and AAAK compression; single-user, in-process | Multi-process deployment; multi-user isolation; network-service semantics |
| [**CrewAI**](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) / [**AutoGen**](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) memory | Per-crew or per-agent embedded memory | Cross-session persistence; compression quality |

### What MNEMOS does that none of them do

**Quality contracts on compression.** When MNEMOS compresses a memory, it produces a manifest: what was removed, what was preserved, the quality rating, and which use cases the compressed version is and is not safe for. No other memory system treats compression as something that requires a receipt. In v3.0 the compression pipeline runs in the background distillation worker with a single engine per memory. v3.1 adds a plugin `CompressionEngine` ABC, a competitive per-memory contest across three engines, and a persisted audit log recording every winner AND loser with its score and disqualification reason — not just the chosen output. Hot-path reads (rehydration, gateway inject, session context) serving winner variants is scheduled for v3.2 alongside the APOLLO engine — see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

**A reasoning layer that degrades gracefully.** GRAEAE distributes queries across multiple LLM providers simultaneously, scores responses on relevance, coherence, completeness, and toxicity, and returns the best result. Per-provider circuit breakers prevent a failing provider from degrading the pool. A semantic cache means identical questions skip inference entirely. This is not a load balancer — it is a quality-gated reasoning bus.

**A knowledge graph alongside free-text memory.** MNEMOS stores structured triples (subject → predicate → object) with temporal validity windows alongside unstructured memories, and exposes a timeline API per subject. Most memory systems are text-only.

---

### MemPalace and MNEMOS: different problems, not competitors

MemPalace, created by Mila Jovanovic, has pushed long-horizon agent memory into the ecosystem in a way few other projects have. The LongMemEval benchmark attention, the AAAK abbreviation research, and the Palace spatial-memory metaphor are real contributions to a problem — keeping agent memory useful across long time horizons without context explosion — that is genuinely unsolved and genuinely hard. It's work worth taking seriously, and MNEMOS has been influenced by several of its ideas.

In particular, MNEMOS shares MemPalace's bets that:

- Memory deserves first-class treatment as a data structure, not as a side-effect of conversation history.
- Compression is a design axis, not an afterthought: if you keep everything raw you lose the context-window fight, and if you compress naively you lose fidelity.
- Long-horizon memory needs structure. Whether you call it a "palace", a DAG, or a temporal knowledge graph, the point is that flat vector similarity runs out of answers fast.

**MNEMOS is not trying to replace MemPalace.** The two projects are solving adjacent problems with different shapes, for different users:

| | MemPalace | MNEMOS |
|---|---|---|
| **Form factor** | Desktop library, embedded in-process | Network service (FastAPI on port 5002), runs as a daemon |
| **Deployment** | `pip install`, runs inside your agent | Deployed alongside your stack the way you'd run PostgreSQL or Redis; many agents and processes connect over REST |
| **Storage** | ChromaDB (SQLite-backed vector store) | PostgreSQL + pgvector with ACID transactions |
| **Primary user** | Individual developer on a single machine | Teams / platforms operating shared infrastructure |
| **Concurrency model** | Single-process, single-user | Multi-tenant with per-owner isolation, multi-process clients |
| **Audit surface** | Local logs | SHA-256 hash-chained audit chain, tamper-evident and externally reviewable |
| **Reasoning** | Storage + retrieval | GRAEAE multi-LLM consensus with quality scoring and provider failover |

If you are one developer building a personal agent that runs on your laptop and you want it to work offline with no infrastructure overhead, MemPalace is designed exactly for that and is a legitimate, well-constructed choice.

If you are a team or a platform deploying shared agent memory that multiple processes need to access concurrently, with an audit trail that stands up to external review, a DB backend that survives crashes and schema migrations, and a reasoning layer you can point a regulator or auditor at, MNEMOS is designed for that.

The shared premise — that agent memory deserves first-class treatment — is the same. The deployment target is not. Please don't read this section as a takedown; it's a map.


## What works now

This is the current state of v3.1.0 — the compression platform release. Features described here are implemented and running in production. Forward-looking scope for v3.1.1 (Tier 3 tenancy fixes) and v3.2–v3.4 (the Apollo Program) is in [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

The API surface is namespaced under `/v1/*`.

### Memory API (v1)

| Endpoint | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /v1/memories` | Store a memory with category, subcategory, content, and optional provenance |
| `GET /v1/memories` | List memories, filterable by category and subcategory |
| `GET /v1/memories/{id}` | Retrieve a single memory |
| `POST /v1/memories/search` | Full-text or semantic search with category/score filters |
| `POST /v1/memories/bulk` | Bulk create memories |
| `PATCH /v1/memories/{id}` | Update memory content or metadata |
| `DELETE /v1/memories/{id}` | Delete a memory |
| `POST /v1/memories/rehydrate` | Token-budgeted context load for prompt injection (v3.2 wires the compression contest's winner variants into this path) |
| `POST /ingest/session` | Ingest a session transcript |
| `GET /v1/memories/{id}/log` | DAG commit history for a memory |
| `POST /v1/memories/{id}/branch` | Create a branch from a specific commit |

| `GET /health` | Health check (not namespaced) |
| `GET /stats` | Memory counts by category, compression statistics |

### Multi-user and provenance (v1, shipped)

Each memory carries full ownership and LLM provenance:

- `owner_id` — which user owns this memory
- `group_id` — optional group for shared access
- `namespace` — logical partition (e.g. `myapp/analyst`)
- `permission_mode` — UNIX-style octal (600 = owner only, 640 = group readable, 644 = world readable)
- `source_model` — the LLM model that produced this memory
- `source_provider` — the provider (openai, groq, ollama, etc.)
- `source_session` — session ID at time of creation
- `source_agent` — agent name or identifier

**Row Level Security** is defined in PostgreSQL but inactive for personal installs. Team/enterprise installs activate it via `install.py`, which enforces per-row access at the database layer, not application middleware.

**Deployment profiles** — selected at install time via `python install.py`:

| Profile | Auth | RLS | Use case |
|---------|------|-----|---------|
| Personal | off | off | Single developer, localhost |
| Team | API key | on | 2–20 users, shared PostgreSQL |
| Enterprise | API key | on | 20+ users, full namespace isolation |

### Admin API (v1)

| Endpoint | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /admin/users` | Create a user |
| `GET /admin/users` | List all users |
| `POST /admin/users/{id}/apikeys` | Generate an API key (raw key returned once) |
| `GET /admin/users/{id}/apikeys` | List API keys for a user |
| `DELETE /admin/apikeys/{id}` | Revoke an API key (soft-delete) |
| `POST /admin/compression/enqueue` | v3.1: enqueue specific memories into `memory_compression_queue` for the contest path. Body: `{memory_ids, reason, scoring_profile, priority}`. Silently skips unknown IDs |
| `POST /admin/compression/enqueue-all` | v3.1: bulk-enqueue up to `limit` (default 500, max 10,000) memories. `only_uncompressed=true` (default) skips memories that already have a variant; set `false` to re-contest under new rules |

All admin endpoints require root role. On personal installs (no auth), they are accessible without a key.

| `GET /v1/providers/health` | Per-provider availability + circuit-breaker state |
| `GET /v1/providers/recommend` | Recommend a model for a task-type + budget |

### OpenAI-compatible gateway (v3, shipped)

Drop-in replacement for the OpenAI Chat Completions API — so any SDK that speaks OpenAI can speak to MNEMOS.

| Endpoint | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /v1/models` | List available models across all configured providers |
| `GET /v1/models/{model_id}` | Model details |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Chat completion; routes to the appropriate provider; optional memory injection |

### Stateful sessions (v3, shipped)

Multi-turn conversation state with memory injection at turn boundaries. Sessions carry accumulated context across requests.

| Endpoint | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /sessions` | Start a new session |
| `GET /sessions/{id}` | Retrieve session state |
| `POST /sessions/{id}/messages` | Post a turn; memory injection at turn boundary |

|----------|-------------|
| `POST /v1/webhooks` | Subscribe; secret returned once |
| `GET /v1/webhooks` | List the caller's subscriptions |
| `GET /v1/webhooks/{id}` | Retrieve a subscription |
| `DELETE /v1/webhooks/{id}` | Revoke (soft-delete) |
| `GET /v1/webhooks/{id}/deliveries` | Recent delivery attempts |

Events: `memory.created`, `memory.updated`, `memory.deleted`, `consultation.completed`. Delivery is durable: every attempt is logged to `webhook_deliveries`, retried 4 times with exponential backoff (1m / 5m / 30m / 2h), and replayed from disk on restart by the recovery worker.

Signature header: `X-MNEMOS-Signature: sha256=<hex>`. Verify with `hmac.new(secret, body, sha256).hexdigest()`.

### OAuth / OIDC authentication (v3, shipped)

Browser-based login via external identity providers. Coexists with API-key auth — the same user can have both a key and an OIDC identity.

| Endpoint | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /auth/oauth/providers` | List enabled providers (public, no secrets) |
| `GET /auth/oauth/{provider}/login` | Start authorization-code + PKCE flow |
| `GET /auth/oauth/{provider}/callback` | Handle provider redirect; sets `mnemos_session` cookie |
| `POST /auth/oauth/logout` | Revoke session (optionally `?all_devices=true`) |
| `GET /auth/oauth/me` | Who am I (works with either auth method) |

Admin side (`/admin/oauth/*` — root only):

| Endpoint | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /admin/oauth/providers` | Register a provider (Google, GitHub, Azure AD, or generic OIDC) |
| `GET /admin/oauth/providers` | List configured providers (client_secret redacted) |
| `PATCH /admin/oauth/providers/{name}` | Update provider config |
| `DELETE /admin/oauth/providers/{name}` | Remove a provider |
| `GET /admin/oauth/identities` | List all OAuth identities (optionally filter by user) |

Sessions are DB-backed, revocable, and expire after 30 days by default. User provisioning: same external-id reuses the user; matching email links to an existing user; otherwise a fresh user is created.

### Federation — cross-instance memory sync (v3, shipped)

Pull-based one-way federation between MNEMOS instances. Remote peer exposes `/v1/federation/feed`; local instance pulls on a configurable interval, storing remote memories with ids of the form `fed:{peer_name}:{remote_id}` and `federation_source = peer_name`. Federated memories are read-only by application convention.

| Endpoint | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /v1/federation/peers` | Register a remote peer (root only) |
| `GET /v1/federation/peers` | List registered peers |
| `GET /v1/federation/peers/{id}` | Peer detail |
| `PATCH /v1/federation/peers/{id}` | Update (enable/disable, filters, interval) |
| `DELETE /v1/federation/peers/{id}` | Unregister |
| `POST /v1/federation/peers/{id}/sync` | Manual sync trigger (blocks on completion) |
| `GET /v1/federation/peers/{id}/log` | Sync history for a peer |
| `GET /v1/federation/status` | Aggregate status across all peers |
| `GET /v1/federation/feed` | Serve memories to remote peers (role=`federation` or `root`) |

**Trust model:** mutual — each side registers the other. Side A issues Side B a Bearer token by creating a MNEMOS user with `role='federation'` and minting an API key via the admin API. Side B stores that token in its own `federation_peers.auth_token`. Side A's feed endpoint validates the token and `role IN ('federation', 'root')`.

**Dedup:** re-pulls are safe. Local id `fed:{peer}:{remote_id}` is stable; only rows with a newer `federation_remote_updated` overwrite existing ones.

**Filters:** `namespace_filter` and `category_filter` (both arrays) restrict what gets pulled from a peer; NULL = pull everything the peer will serve.

**Loop prevention:** the feed endpoint excludes memories where `federation_source IS NOT NULL`, so federated memories don't propagate hop-by-hop through a chain of peers.

### GRAEAE engine internals (all operational)

The reasoning engine behind `/v1/consultations` provides:

- **Circuit breaker** — per-provider CLOSED/OPEN/HALF_OPEN state machine, 5-minute cooldown
- **Consensus response cache** — per-process LRU keyed on `sha256(task_type + normalized_prompt)`, 1-hour TTL, 500-entry cap. Exact-match dedup, not embedding similarity (embedding round-trip would negate the win for the less-common near-duplicate case).
- **Quality scorer** — success / failure / latency tracking per provider, combined with Arena.ai Elo weights from the model registry (see next section) for dynamic consensus weighting
- **Rate limiter** — single-level request rate limit with graceful backoff
- **Audit chain** — SHA-256 hash-chained prompt/response log for compliance

### Model registry and dynamic provider weighting (self-maintaining)

Most multi-LLM routers hardcode a provider list. MNEMOS ships a **self-populating PostgreSQL-backed model registry** that keeps itself current.

**What's in the registry.** Every known model from every configured provider — OpenAI, Groq, xAI, Together, Nvidia, Gemini, Anthropic — with per-model metadata: provider + model_id, display name, family (grok-4, gpt-5, gemini-3, …), capabilities (`chat`, `vision`, `code`, `reasoning`, `web_search`), context window, max output tokens, input / output / cache pricing (USD per million tokens), availability, deprecation flag, **Arena.ai Elo score**, **Arena.ai rank**, and the normalized `graeae_weight` (0.50–1.00) actually used by the consensus scorer.

**How it populates.**

- **Daily provider sync** — `graeae.provider_sync` hits each provider's `/v1/models` endpoint (Gemini uses `/v1beta/models`; Anthropic uses a static list because Anthropic does not expose a public `/models` surface) and upserts into `model_registry`. New models appear automatically; deprecated ones get flagged. No manual curation required.
- **Quarterly Elo sync** — `scripts/refresh_elo_weights.py` (systemd: `graeae-elo-sync.timer`) fetches the Arena.ai leaderboard, maps ranks back to providers + models, and writes `arena_score`, `arena_rank`, and `graeae_weight` into the registry.
- **Online quality signals** — the GRAEAE engine tracks per-provider success / failure / latency in memory; those signals combine with the registry's Elo-derived `graeae_weight` to pick the winning response on each consultation.

**What it's used for.**

- **`/v1/providers/recommend?task_type=...&budget=...`** — returns the cheapest available model that meets the task's capability + quality floor. Uses `graeae_weight` as the quality signal and `input_cost_per_mtok + output_cost_per_mtok` as the cost signal.
- **GRAEAE consensus scoring** — provider responses are weighted by `graeae_weight` before the consensus pick. A provider that drops on Arena.ai also drops in MNEMOS's internal routing on the next timer tick, without any human touching a config file.
- **OpenAI-compatible gateway model routing** — when a caller passes `model="auto"`, `model="best-coding"`, `model="best-reasoning"`, `model="fastest"`, `model="cheapest"`, the gateway resolves against the registry rather than a hardcoded alias table.

**Fresh-install behavior.** If the registry is empty (first boot, no sync run yet), `/v1/providers/recommend` falls back to the static GRAEAE provider config so new deployments don't 404. The first `provider_sync` run typically populates 30–50 models depending on which provider API keys you've configured.

### What runs under the hood (infrastructure you don't have to think about)

A lot of the v3.x surface is held up by background work that doesn't show up in the route table but does show up in the failure modes it prevents. For anyone who wants to know what's there:

- **Webhook delivery recovery worker** — on startup, walks `webhook_deliveries` and re-drains any rows stuck in `pending` or `retrying` with a `scheduled_at` in the past. Handles the crash-mid-retry case; subscribers get the delivery eventually rather than never.
- **Distillation worker supervision** — the compression worker runs under an exponential-backoff supervisor (1s → 2s → 4s → … capped at 5 min). A crash is logged and retried; the worker does not silently die and leave memories un-compressed for the rest of the process lifetime.
- **OAuth session garbage collector** — hourly sweep of expired and long-revoked sessions. Bounds the `oauth_sessions` table so a long-running install doesn't accumulate dead rows forever.
- **Federation sync worker** — iterates enabled peers on their individual sync intervals, pulls batches, reconciles local + remote timestamps before overwriting, logs per-sync results to `federation_sync_log`.
- **Advisory-lock-serialized audit chain writer** — the hash chain writer takes `pg_advisory_xact_lock` before reading the chain tip, so concurrent consultations cannot compute against the same stale previous hash. Closes a TOCTOU window in tamper-evident logging that most implementations leave open.
- **Advisory-lock-serialized DAG merges** — merges take a per-`(memory_id, target_branch)` advisory lock, so concurrent merges on the same branch cannot produce orphan commits or duplicate version numbers.
- **ASGI body-size middleware** — native ASGI (not `BaseHTTPMiddleware`), so it rejects chunked uploads whose running byte count exceeds `MAX_BODY_BYTES` *as they arrive*, before the full body lands in memory. Content-Length–declared uploads are rejected before the app is even invoked.
- **SSRF-hardened webhook dispatch** — URLs are re-validated at send time (not just at subscription time); DNS resolves asynchronously so a slow resolver can't freeze the event loop; cloud metadata hostnames (AWS IMDS, Google `metadata.google.internal`, Tencent, Alibaba, IPv6 variants) are on a deny list alongside the RFC1918 / loopback / link-local filter.
- **Rate limiter with X-Forwarded-For trust** — default keys on direct socket peer (safe behind no proxy); set `RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_PROXY=true` only when you run behind a proxy you control. Prevents clients from blowing out the global limit via spoofed headers.
- **pgvector query sanitization** — embedding vectors returned by the embedder are `float()`-cast before being stringified into the query. A poisoned embedder cannot inject SQL via a non-numeric vector "component".
- **Full-text search operator filtering** — `/v1/memories/search` uses `plainto_tsquery` rather than `to_tsquery`, so `|`, `&`, `!` and friends get treated as literal text instead of tsquery operators. User input cannot construct adversarial FTS queries.
- **Federation size caps** — an abusive peer cannot fill your disk: pulled content capped at 1 MB per memory, metadata at 64 KB, name fields at 256 chars.
- **Rate-limited audit endpoints** — `/v1/consultations/audit/verify` walks the entire chain from genesis; capped at 5/min so an authenticated caller cannot force O(N) scans on a large log. `/audit` list is capped at 30/min.
- **Quality manifest on every compression** — every compression engine in the stack (LETHE, ANAMNESIS, APOLLO in v3.3+) writes a receipt: `{what_was_removed, what_was_preserved, quality_rating, risk_factors, safe_for, not_safe_for}`. Compression-as-data, not compression-as-side-effect.

### Referential integrity (the -ism, spelled out)

Every cross-table reference in the schema is a real PostgreSQL foreign key with an explicit `ON DELETE` semantic — not a loose string column you have to trust the application layer to honour. Twenty-two FK edges across the system, and every one carries a deliberate decision about what happens when the thing it points at goes away. The schema has opinions.

Two patterns, picked per edge:

**`ON DELETE CASCADE`** — when lifecycle is genuinely owned:

- `api_keys.user_id → users(id)` — delete a user, their keys go with them.
- `sessions.user_id → users(id)`, `session_messages.session_id → sessions(id)` — close a session, its messages go.
- `user_groups.user_id → users(id)`, `user_groups.group_id → groups(id)` — membership is owned by both endpoints.
- `webhook_subscriptions.owner_id → users(id)`, `webhook_deliveries.subscription_id → webhook_subscriptions(id)` — subscriber deletion collapses the whole delivery subtree (soft-delete via `revoked=true` is the normal path; CASCADE only matters on hard deletes).
- `oauth_identities.user_id → users(id)`, `oauth_identities.provider → oauth_providers(name)`, `oauth_sessions.user_id → users(id)` — OAuth bindings follow their owner.
- `federation_sync_log.peer_id → federation_peers(id)` — unregister a peer, its sync history goes.
- `graeae_audit_log.consultation_id → graeae_consultations(id)`, `consultation_memory_refs.consultation_id → graeae_consultations(id)` — audit rows are owned by the consultation they describe. Chain integrity comes from the SHA-256 hash chain, not from the FK, so deleting a consultation does not break the chain's verifiability.

**`ON DELETE SET NULL`** — when audit history has to *survive* the referenced row's deletion:

- `memory_versions.parent_version_id → memory_versions(id)` — admin-path deletion of a mid-history commit leaves the DAG with a gap rather than cascading through every descendant.
- `memory_branches.head_version_id → memory_versions(id)` — same reasoning; branches get re-pointed, not destroyed.
- `session_memory_injections.memory_id → memories(id)` — if a memory is deleted later, the *record that we once injected it into a session* stays. The audit outlives the artifact.
- `compression_quality_log.memory_id → memories(id)` — the quality manifest survives the thing it was a manifest for. Compliance cares that the transformation happened, not that the output still exists.
- `consultation_memory_refs.memory_id → memories(id)` — a consultation's cited memory may be deleted; the *record of the citation* is an audit artifact and must not vanish.
- `oauth_sessions.identity_id → oauth_identities(id)` — rotating an identity doesn't invalidate a session row that was already in flight.

This is the part most projects that call themselves "memory" skip, because if the whole point is "store a blob, retrieve a blob", the relationships *between* blobs are out of scope. MNEMOS's design asserts the opposite: memories relate to consultations relate to audit entries relate to sessions relate to users, and the system has strong opinions about which of those relationships is load-bearing and which is historical.

The constraints are enforced at the database level. Application bugs cannot violate them. Migration bugs cannot silently create orphan rows. The constraint travels with the row.

### Compression — the MOIRAI tiers

Tiered compression pipeline, each tier named after a Greek figure of memory.

- **LETHE** (Tier 1, CPU, runs in the distillation worker) — fast local compression with two modes: token mode (stop-word + importance-marker extractive filtering, ~0.5ms, ~57% reduction on functional-word-heavy prose) and sentence mode (structure-preserving sentence-boundary extraction, ~2–5ms, ~50% reduction). `auto` mode picks per content shape. Zero external calls.
- **ANAMNESIS** (Tier 3, optional GPU) — atomic-fact extraction for archival memories (>30 days old); semantic-level compression via LLM. Fallback: skip extraction if the GPU host is unreachable (non-critical).
- **APOLLO** (v3.3+, Tier 2 replacement) — schema-aware dense encoding for LLM-to-LLM wire use. Rule-based schema detection with LLM fallback for fact-shaped content that misses a known schema. See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) Apollo Program.
- **ALETHEIA** (v3.1, retired v3.2 tail) — token-level importance scoring via LLM. Lost every contest in the 2026-04-23 CERBERUS benchmark (index-list prompt incompatible with instruction-tuned generalist LLMs). Kept importable via `MNEMOS_ALETHEIA_ENABLED=true` for operators who had it opted in; emits a `DeprecationWarning` on construction; v4.0 removes.
- Quality manifest on every compression: what was removed, what was preserved, risk factors, safe/unsafe use cases.
- Original content always retained; compressed and original stored independently.
- Configurable quality thresholds per task type (security review: 95%, architecture: 90%, general: 80%).
- v3.1 adds a plugin `CompressionEngine` ABC (open to operator-registered engines), a competitive per-memory contest across every eligible engine, and a persisted audit log of winner + every loser with its score and rejection reason. See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

### Memory tiers (4-tier system)

| Tier | Description | Compression ratio |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Recent / active | 20% |
| 2 | Short-term | 35% |
| 3 | Medium-term | 50% |
| 4 | Long-term / archive | task-type dependent |

### Versioning and audit

- Memory version history (`memory_versions` table) — every mutation auto-snapshots previous state
- Diff and revert API: `GET /v1/memories/{id}/versions`, `GET /v1/memories/{id}/versions/{n}`, `GET /v1/memories/{id}/diff`, `POST /v1/memories/{id}/revert/{n}`
- DAG (git-like) versioning: `GET /v1/memories/{id}/log`, `POST /v1/memories/{id}/branch`, `POST /v1/memories/{id}/merge`, `GET /v1/memories/{id}/commits/{commit}`
- SHA-256 hash-chained audit log for consultations: `GET /v1/consultations/audit`, `GET /v1/consultations/audit/verify`

---

## Roadmap

### Shipped in v3.0

Landed with the v3.0 release line:

- ✅ **Webhook subscriptions** — outbound notifications on memory write, consultation completion. HMAC-signed delivery, retry with exponential backoff.
- ✅ **OAuth/OIDC authentication** — browser-based login via Google, GitHub, Azure AD, or custom OIDC providers. Coexists with existing API-key auth.
- ✅ **Cross-instance memory federation** — pull-based peer sync with Bearer-authenticated peers. Federated memories stored locally with `federation_source` metadata, `fed:{peer}:{remote_id}` id prefix, and a background worker that respects per-peer sync intervals.

### Shipped in v3.1 (current)

- ✅ **Plugin `CompressionEngine` ABC** — open extension point; operators register additional engines alongside the built-ins (LETHE, ANAMNESIS; APOLLO in v3.3+; ALETHEIA retired from the default contest in v3.2 tail).
- ✅ **Competitive-selection compression contest** — every eligible engine runs per memory; highest composite_score wins; every loser recorded with its reject_reason. Scoring profile is operator-configurable (`balanced` | `quality_first` | `speed_first` | `custom`).
- ✅ **Persisted audit log** — three new tables (`memory_compression_queue`, `memory_compression_candidates`, `memory_compressed_variants`) with full history queryable via `GET /v1/memories/{id}/compression-manifests`.
- ✅ **GPU circuit breaker** — per-endpoint three-state breaker (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED); gpu_required engines fast-fail during outages instead of piling requests onto a dead endpoint.
- ✅ **Admin enqueue endpoints** — `POST /admin/compression/enqueue` (specific memory IDs) and `POST /admin/compression/enqueue-all` (bulk with filters) for operators to drive the contest from the API layer.
- ✅ **Optional too-short content gate** — `MNEMOS_CONTEST_MIN_CONTENT_LENGTH` skips memories below a threshold before spending GPU time on content that can't be meaningfully compressed.
- ✅ **v2 versioning trigger bytea fix** — the `mnemos_version_snapshot()` trigger no longer crashes on memories containing backslash sequences (common in code, paths, regex, logs).

### Beyond v3.1

Forward-looking scope is maintained in [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md), which lists committed v3.1 scope, the v3.2–v3.4 Apollo Program staged rollout, and items explicitly deferred with rationale.

Near-term not-yet-scoped candidates (v3.5+):

- Distributed consensus for multi-writer federation
- Server-push streaming API for long-lived subscriptions
- Direct-import adapters for major memory competitors (beyond the current `POST /v1/memories/bulk` manual path)

## FAQ

### Why is it called MNEMOS, and why are you using all these mythological names — who do you think you are, a fantasy novelist?

Fair question, and we get it more than you'd think. Short answer: the names aren't set dressing. Each one is a functional tag that happens to line up with a real Greek concept, because memory is one of the domains where Greek already had the vocabulary we needed.

- **MNEMOS** — short for Mnemosyne, the Titan goddess of memory and mother of the Muses. The system stores and retrieves memory. "MemoryService" felt like underselling it.
- **GRAEAE** — the three sisters in the Perseus myth who shared one eye and one tooth, passing them back and forth to see and speak. GRAEAE is the multi-LLM consensus layer: several providers sharing one prompt and converging on one consolidated answer. The metaphor was already sitting there.
- **THE MOIRAI** — the three Fates, who spin, measure, and cut the thread of life. The compression stack is collectively THE MOIRAI because each tier decides what part of a memory's thread survives:
  - **LETHE** (river of forgetfulness) — Tier 1, CPU, fast, aggressive: throws away what you won't miss.
  - **ANAMNESIS** (recollection) — Tier 3, archival, slowest: distills long-term facts so you can recover them years later.
  - **APOLLO** (god of oracles — schema-aware prophecy) — v3.3+, the third going-forward tier: schema-typed dense encoding for LLM-to-LLM wire use; humans read through a narrator at read time.
  - **ALETHEIA** (literally *a-lethe*, "unforgetting" — truth, disclosure) — v3.1 third engine, retired in the v3.2 tail (0 contest wins in the 2026-04-23 benchmark); kept importable, v4.0 removes.

No, we are not fantasy novelists. The naming scheme is what happens when the domain you're working in is literally the thing a pre-Socratic culture wrote whole theogonies about, and you decide to use their vocabulary instead of inventing a worse one. Every name is aligned to what the component does, not chosen for atmosphere.

If you strongly prefer `MemoryService` / `LLMRouter` / `CompressorTier1`, the code does exactly the same thing regardless of the label. They're just tags. We like ours.

### Do I need GPU hardware?

No. CPU-only installs run fine — LETHE (Tier 1 compression) runs on CPU, and the API server itself never needs a GPU. ANAMNESIS (GPU-optional, archival fact extraction) and the optional local GPU inference backends only kick in when `GPU_PROVIDER_HOST` is configured. For most deployments, CPU plus one external LLM provider is enough.

### Does it work with [OpenAI / Anthropic / Groq / Together / local Ollama]?

Yes. GRAEAE routes across any configured provider. Together AI and Groq are the default free-tier providers (no paid account required to get started). OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity are supported as fallback providers. Local Ollama is first-class — MNEMOS can run fully offline with Ollama plus `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings.

### Is there a hosted version?

Not today. Self-hosted only.

### How is this different from Mem0 / Zep / MemPalace / LangChain memory?

See the *MemPalace and MNEMOS: different problems, not competitors* section above, plus the comparison table. Short version: those are in-process libraries or conversation-history stores designed for single-user / single-agent deployment. MNEMOS is a network service with multi-tenant isolation, a cryptographic audit chain, and a DAG-versioned memory model. Different form factor, different primary user.

### Does it phone home or collect telemetry?

No. There is no outbound telemetry of any kind. The only outbound traffic is the LLM provider calls you configure yourself, the webhook deliveries you register, and the federation syncs you set up. The code is all here; grep `httpx` if you want to confirm.

### Can I use it in production?

Yes — we have been since December 2025. v3.0 is the first public release line, not a greenfield experiment; the codebase has been operated continuously for roughly four months before being cut for open source. The honest caveat: it has been single-operator-tested, not yet battle-tested across many independent deployments. File issues against the live install and we'll track them.

### What's the migration story from [Mem0 / Zep / raw PostgreSQL]?

Currently manual — write a one-shot script that hits `POST /v1/memories/bulk` with your source data. Direct-import adapters for major competitors are on the roadmap but not yet shipped.

### Why port 5002 and not something normal like 8080?

Historical. Earlier versions split MNEMOS (5000) and GRAEAE (5001) across two services; v3 unified them on 5002 to signal "this is the combined single service". Override with `MNEMOS_PORT` if 5002 is taken.

### Does it run in Docker / Kubernetes?

Yes. `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` ship in the repo; `docker compose up -d` gets you a working MNEMOS + PostgreSQL instance for local evaluation. For Kubernetes, the Docker image is the starting point — no Helm chart yet, but the service is stateless on its own (Postgres is the only state), so a standard Deployment + Service + ConfigMap pattern works.

### How do I secure it in production?

- Set `MNEMOS_API_KEY` and require Bearer auth on all requests.
- Enable `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true` (it's on by default).
- Set `MNEMOS_SESSION_SECRET` to a stable value so OAuth flows survive restarts.
- Set `OAUTH_TRUST_PROXY=true` + `RATE_LIMIT_TRUST_PROXY=true` only when you're behind a reverse proxy you control.
- Keep `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=false` (the default). SSRF defense is on by default.
- Run behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy. Don't expose the Uvicorn socket directly.
- Review `SECURITY.md` for the full checklist.
