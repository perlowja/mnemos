"""Adversarial / false-positive regression tests.

Each case below was caught by a Codex aggressive review of the
Apollo schemas. They're prose that happened to carry shallow surface
features the schemas keyed on. The tests assert that the schemas
now DO NOT fire on these inputs — they fall through to the LLM
fallback (or Artemis) instead of producing a garbled dense form.
