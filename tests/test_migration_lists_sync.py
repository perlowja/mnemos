"""Regression guard: install.py and installer/db.py migration lists
must stay in sync. Codex review (thread 019dbcc5) flagged drift
between the two as a fresh-install footgun — operators following
the README ran install.py, which stopped at v3_ownership and left
the v3.1.x tables missing, producing 503 on /v1/consultations.

This test extracts the `migration_files` list from each file via
AST and asserts they're equal, in order. It's intentionally a
mechanical check — if you need to add a migration, add it to BOTH
lists (at the end) and this test will pass again.
